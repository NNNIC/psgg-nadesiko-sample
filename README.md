# Nadesiko sample

Because most of Naesiko's users are novice programmer, I use simple theory for State Machine.
StateGo's state require only A command otherwise other languages require 'init' , 'update' , 'wait', and 'post_wait".

# Nadesiko has V1 and V3.

V1 is Nadesiko Windows' version.
V3 is OS indepent version. It works on node.js or Web brwser.

# Notice

About V3 sample, I did not take into account using Nadesiko on browser very much. It should be thought carefully to create like Javascript sample.
